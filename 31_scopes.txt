With the term scope/scopes its meant that we have to know where a variable is defined and when its valid.

as example :

if new_variable == 5:
	print("In scope")

new_variable = 5

Here we would get an error in the code because the new variable is not in scope anymore.
The new_variable is defined after the first use of it so how should it know if the value is 5 or not.Thats why it is out of scope.

new_variable = 5

if new_variable == 5:
	print("In scope")


In this case the code would work because the variable is defined before the use case of it.
You have to be aware that the variables,functions and many more things you wanna use are already defined somewhere before you wanna use them.
